# Security Framework

This document outlines the key security measures that protect the MallQuest platform. These safeguards are inspired by our internal `SecurityFramework` interface and cover anti-cheat defenses and data protection practices.

## Anti-Cheat Defenses

### Location Spoofing
- **Multi-source verification** combining GPS, WiFi and beacon data to confirm user presence.
- **Movement pattern analysis** to detect inconsistent or impossible travel behavior.
- **Impossible travel detection** that flags jumps between distant locations in unrealistic timeframes.
- **Photo verification** required for high-value rewards to prove user presence.

### Exploitation
- **Server-authoritative architecture** so all critical actions are validated on the server.
- **Rate limiting** on a per-user and per-IP basis to block automation and brute-force attacks.
- **Behavioral anomaly detection** using machine learning to identify unusual usage patterns.
- **Device fingerprinting** to recognize and track unique hardware characteristics.
- **Honeypot traps** designed to lure and detect malicious actors.

### Account Abuse
- **One account per device** policy prevents multi-accounting from the same hardware.
- **Phone number verification** to ensure each account is linked to a valid identity.
- **Know Your Customer (KYC)** checks for large withdrawals or high-value transactions.
- **Multi-account detection algorithms** to find users operating multiple profiles.

## Data Protection

- **Encryption:** All data at rest is encrypted using AES-256.
- **Transmission:** Only TLS 1.3 or higher is permitted for network communications.
- **Privacy:** The system complies with GDPR and CCPA requirements.
- **Anonymization:** Personal data is anonymized whenever possible to protect user identity.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security issue, please report it by opening a new issue in this repository or contacting the maintainers directly. Provide as much detail as possible so we can reproduce and address the problem quickly.
