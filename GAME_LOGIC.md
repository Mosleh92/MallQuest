# Game Logic

## Wager Match Rewards

- Players join a match by staking coins, creating a shared **pot**.
- Eliminating an opponent transfers their stake directly to the killer as a **kill reward**; this does not affect the pot.
- When only one squad has surviving members, the remaining pot is split evenly among those teammates.
- If players from more than one squad survive when the match ends, it is treated as a tie and the pot is divided equally among all survivors.
- Assists are not tracked: only the credited killer receives a kill reward, and assists do not influence pot distribution.
