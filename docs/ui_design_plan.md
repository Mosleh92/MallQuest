## Technology Stack

- Integrate i18n support for English and Arabic from the start.

## Layout Concepts
- Dashboard with modular widgets for coins, missions and notifications.
- Mobile-first navigation drawer with quick access to receipt scanning and battles.

## Visual Style
- Vibrant gradient backgrounds paired with glassmorphism cards.
- Subtle animations for page transitions and reward pop-ups.

## Next Actions

2. Build login and player dashboard pages.
3. Connect pages to existing backend APIs via Swagger definitions.
